# 🌐 ScratchPage

**ScratchPage** is a fully functional website made entirely in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) / [PenguinMod](https://penguinmod.com), demonstrating the creative and technical possibilities of building web-like experiences inside a visual programming environment designed for education and experimentation.

> 🚧 Built 100% inside Scratch/PenguinMod — no HTML, CSS, or JavaScript required.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project explores how far Scratch (and by extension, PenguinMod) can be pushed as a platform — not just for games and animations, but for full interactive websites. It showcases how logic, navigation, UI/UX, and multimedia can all be simulated inside a block-based environment.

## 🧠 Features

- 🖱️ Clickable navigation (like buttons)
- 🖼️ Image and text rendering using sprites and costumes
- 🎨 Custom design and UI/UX made with Scratch graphics
- 🔄 Page transitions, and interactivity
- 📱 Designed to be responsive (as much as Scratch allows)

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) – Original version
- [PenguinMod](https://penguinmod.com) – Enhanced fork with more features (required)

## 🚀 How It Works
